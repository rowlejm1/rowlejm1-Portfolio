            <p>Currently at the end of the second year of studying a Bachelor of Information Technology at Otago
             Polytechnic. In 2016 I studied the Certificate in IT service and support. When I finished my second 
             semester of the certificate with straight A's I decided that I should push myself and this lead me to be 
             accepted into the bachelor.</p>

            <h2>Interests</h2>
            <p>The thing that interests me the most has always been computers. After I began studying I found I had a 
                passion for programming. I enjoy solving a problem in an elegant way. Over the course of my studies I intend 
                to be learning aspects of game development with the end goal of producing a basic playable game. I have 
            played around with Unity to see what I can do with the engine.</p>
